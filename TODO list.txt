Damage types

Steam: If not bypassing armor, damage is reduced by armor twice.  If bypassing armor, damage is increased by armor value
Fire: Bypasses armor, is increased by armor value



Potion effects
Wet: Adds duration if you are in water or rain, up to a max.  If you are burning at any time for its duration, it deals minor steam damage, removes burning and then removes itself
Frozen: Triggers if you touch ice while wet.  Removes wet and stops movement until you take damage once or the duration runs out.  If you start burning while frozen, frozen and burning are both removed.
Burning: Triggers when set on fire, and sets you on fire when it is triggered.  Puts out the fire when it ends...basically just trying to link normal burning to a usable potion effect
Deflection: % chance of deflecting attacks

Doom: Instant death if it is not removed before the countdown hits 0.  OP if not filtered carefully
Voidwalker: Allows you to walk on / place blocks on the void at the bottom of the world, as if it were solid; mostly useful in the end
